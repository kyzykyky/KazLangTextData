I am asked by the Faculty of Law, of L.M Gumilyev to provide a brief summary of my forthcoming monograph on direct democracy
In this study, I compared legal and political issues of contemporary direct democracy in the following polities:Switzerland,Italy,American States,France,Denmark,Ireland, theUKandTurkey.Devices of direct democracy are the constitutional instruments where public votes on a certain issue
They may be largely divided into referendums and popular initiatives
A referendum may be obligatory (mandatory) or facultative(optional)
When it is obligatory, it is a constitutional rule that certain laws be put to referendum before they come into effect
This instrument is observed in most cases, for the constitutional changes which are very important for the future of the nation
For example, according to Article 3 of Azerbaijan Constitution, amendments to the constitution and change of state borders of theAzerbaijanRepublicmay be only changed by the referendum
Also in some other countries, referendum is obligatory for constitutional amendments such asAustria,Australia,SwitzerlandandIreland
In some other countries, referendum is obligatory only if the parliament cannot reach to a certain majority
For example inTurkey, constitutional amendments are subject to referendum if the proposed amendment receives a support between 3/5 and 2/3 of the total numbers of the parliament
If parliament secures a majority above 2/3 numbers of the total members, that is, more than 367 members, then the referendum is facultative
Facultative referendums are those which are initiated by certain organs or persons
In certain constitutions of the world the power to initiate a referendum may be conferred to, the president, certain number of parliamentary members, certain number of the electors
InFrance, according to the article 11, the president has the right to decide to hold a referendum
InTurkey; the president may hold a referendum, for the constitutional amendment proposals, which receive the votes of more than 2/3 of the total members of the parliament
On the other hand inDenmark, it is the parliamentary minority that can decide to hold a referendum
According to Danish constitution, 1/3 of the total members of the parliament may decide to hold a referendum
In countries such asSwitzerland,Estoniaand Latvia Referendum may be started on the demand of certain number of voters (numbers vary from 50.000 to 300.000 voters) In these countries, referendums are hold during the adoption of laws
On the other hand, inItaly, 500.000 electors may demand a referendum to abrogate an existing law
This is called abrogative referendum.While the referendums are the votes on the text adopted by the parliament, the electors themselves may also propose a constitutional or legal amendment and put it to referendum
This device is called popular initiative
In Switzerland, a number of 7 between 27 people may propose a constitutional amendment
 This proposal should receive 100.000 signatures in 18 months starting from the publication of the proposal in the Federal Official Gazette (Feuille Fédérale).
If it receives the required signatures, the proposal is put to referendum.One common theme is the judicial review of the voting procedures of the referendums and the legislative products of them
The legal rationale here rests on the constitutional principle that elections, referendums and any other sort of public votes should be implemented under the control of judicial review
In this context, there are two distinct but interacting issues at stake: The voting right of each individual and constitutional due process of direct legislation
In almost all cases, Constitutional Courts or an equivalent supreme court is competent to fulfill the judicial review.The holder of the constitutional competence to initiate a referendum is one of the most important issues
 At this point the right to initiate referendum should belong to the opposition who wish to prevent the adoption of a legislative measure in question
In other words, the owner of the proposal of a legal measure should not have the right to start a referendum on it
More importantly, the executive, particularly, president should not have the exclusive right to start a referendum
Its effects may vary according to the governmental system and party configuration in the parliament
Firstly in this context, it should be remembered that comparative studies on referendum show that, the executive is always more successful in the strategic use of the referendum
In most cases it produces hegemonic results, that is, referendum may turn to a manipulative device in the hand of the executive
The examples ofFranceandTurkeyillustrate clear examples
InTurkey, the president has the sole and exclusive competence to start a referendum
(Art.175) In France, the president may initiate a referendum on the proposal of the government.(Art
11) Yet even in this latter case, the condition, ‘proposal of the government’ becomes futile, when the president and the parliamentary majority are from the same political party
In short, in all cases when the president has the power to start a referendum it may produce counter-parliamentary and anti-consensual results
The main problem lies in the fact that initiating a referendum is a legislative power, and conferring such a power to the president may  risk functioning of the checks and  balances system by giving the president a strengthened veto or law making power.It is observed and considered that if the right to start a referendum is given to the electoral or parliamentary minorities, it may serve better to the functioning of democracy
This gives the opposition a very important power in the parliamentary debates
It therefore, induces the parliamentary majorities to reach a certain consensus with the minority to avoid referendums and prevent a high-handed way of decision making
In short, referendums should generate an effect of minority protection and veto power, as a filter to the decision of the majority.Referendum campaigns are also important in the proper functioning of the direct democracy
Campaigns include two elements: voter education and propaganda
The former involves the education of the voters of the legal nature and content of the question to be voted in the referendum
It is very important that the voter education is fulfilled by an impartial body, as it should be done neutrally
On the contrary, propaganda aims at persuading the citizenry to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and at this point fairness and democratic standards should be considered
In this case, a perfect legal framework for, campaign finance, free and equal right to media, freedom of speech and assembly is very important
        Another conclusion derived from our study is the role of the political parties
The political parties may play a very important role in the functioning of the referendum, most notably during the campaigns
The heuristic cues, information and recommendations given by the political parties to their voters may considerably reduce the risk of voter incompetence, a setback commonly stated by the skeptics of direct democracy.The question posed in the referendum, should be clear, short and free of ambiguity
The voters should easily understand the legal effect of their yes or no votes
In this case, the questions should clear legal regulations, and not some ambiguous statement of political goals.Single subject rule is universal in the securing of a genuine democratic referendum
According to this rule, voters should not be compelled to log-roll a package of diverse legal provisions which are not reasonably germane in content and meaning.To conclude, our study illustrates that referendums may contribute to the well-functioning of the democracies if: there is an effective and impartial judicial review, the misuse of it by the executive is prevented by constitutional measures, it serves as a constitutional weapon in the hands of the minority, the basic democratic principles of freedom of thought, speech and information are secured.
