Gemini, the sign of the Twins, is dual-natured, elusive, complex and contradictory
On the one hand it produces the virtue of versatility, and on the other the vices of two-facedness and flightiness
The sign is linked with Mercury, the planet of childhood and youth, and its subjects tend to have the graces and faults of the young
When they are good, they are very attractive; when they are bad they are more the worse for being the charmers they are
Like children they are lively, and happy, if circumstances are right for them, or egocentric, imaginative and restless
They take up new activities enthusiastically
To them life is a game which must always be full of fresh moves and continuous entertainment, free of labor and routine.Their good qualities are attractive and come easily to them
They are affectionate, courteous, kind, generous, and thoughtful towards the poor and suffering — provided none of the activities resulting from expressing these traits interferes too greatly with their own lives and comforts
They quickly learn to use their outward attractiveness to gain their own ends, and when striving for these they will use any weapon in their armory -  escaping blame by contriving to put it on other people, wrapped up in all the charm they can turn on
In their better moments they may strive to be honest and straightforward, but self-interest is almost always the victor
If things go against them, they sulk like children.Also like children, they demand attention, admiration, and the spending on them of time, energy and money, throwing tantrums if they don’t get what they want
They reflect every change in their surroundings, like chameleons, and can become pessimistic, sullen, peevish and materialistically self-centered if circumstances force them to struggle in any way
If the conditions of life become really adverse, their strength of will may desert them entirely
They can become  irritable, with «Self» looming ever larger in their struggles
On the other hand their versatility can make them very adaptable.Most Gemini have a keen, intuitive, sometimes brilliant intelligence and they love cerebral challenges
Their mental agility and energy give them a voracious appetite for knowledge from youth onward, though they dislike the labor of learning
They easily grasp almost everything requiring intelligence and mental dexterity, and are often able to marry manual skills to their qualities of mind
Their intellect is strongly analytical and sometimes gives them so great an ability to see both sides of a question that they vacillate and find it hard to make decisions.In love they are fickle, not intentionally so but because of the basic inconsistency of their emotional nature
Gemini subjects take nothing seriously.They like intrigue, the excitement of the chase, but once they have caught the prey, they lose interest and look around for the next creature to pursue.Gemini can be successful in many walks of life though their general characteristics tend to make them unreliable
They are often skilled manipulators of language, in speech and writing, and may be: debaters, diplomats (though in politics they are more interested in theory than practice), orators, preachers (brilliant rather than profound), teachers, authors, poets, journalists, or lawyers
In business any work which combines quick-wittedness with a change of surroundings suits them; working as a traveling salesperson, brokerage work, or dealing with the public in any capacity is right up their alley.LIKES Talking Novelty and the unusual Variety in life Multiple projects all going at once Reading DISLIKES Feeling tied down Learning, such as school Being in a rut Mental inaction Being alone
