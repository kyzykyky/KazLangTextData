My motherland and my destinyThe greatest of all blessings, -at least, then, withoutwhich you cannot useother, is independence.In my point of view my home is a beautiful motherland, the Republic of Kazakhstan This is a great country with a rich history, ancient culture and unique nature
When the North is still snow at the foot of the mountains in the South are already blooming fruit trees
“Birch chintz” North, mighty pine Borovoye, Goldencornfields of virgin territory, grey feather-grasses of the great Steppe, high mountains Alatau and Tien Shan - all my Kazakhstan
These paintings amaze me with his incredible beauty
I will never cease to admire.There's blue sky and snow-capped mountains,Endless fields of Golden expanses.Sunsets like in a fairy tale and starry nights,Dawns clear as beauty's eyes...Mineral resources of Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources: gas, oil, coal, ferrous and nonferrous metals
It's all property of the people of Kazakhstan, which got him a no-brainer.In other hand if you delve into history, Kazakhstan took more than two hundred years to get its independence
Thousands of people fought for the freedom of our country, many died for the future of their homeland
Since ancient times, the ancestors defended our lands from the attacks of the Dzungars
In the period of tsarist people have seen the death and injustice, sorrow and unhappiness, they knew what the loss
Also the people of Kazakhstan took an active part in the great Patriotic war, as part of a single country
Tens of thousands of heroes from Kazakhstan showed the courage and the will to total victory
Thanks to these people we live in the state, free and independent
In conclusion all this thanks to the unity and cohesion of the people and the shared belief in a bright future
We must remember these people and be proud of true patriots of our country.I would like to share about  my destiny,after much thought, I have come to the conclusion that everyone in the world has a destiny to fulfill
Some people think they know their destinies, but sometimes it doesn’t work out
For example, in one of my favorite movies, Forrest Gump, Lt
Dan thought he knew his destiny until he lost both his legs
He was extremely upset because he thought that his destiny was to die on the battlefield; instead he was saved by Forrest, but lost his legs
It wasn’t until later in the movie that he finally thanked Forrest for saving his life, realizing perhaps he had another destiny to become a successful businessman, and that he wasn’t meant to die in the field
For most of my young life, I didn’t think I was unusualWhile watching the scene in Forrest Gump when Lt
Dan and Forrest discuss the idea of destiny, I began to realize maybe I did not yet know my destiny
Maybe I wasn’t meant to be selected for the groups of which I wanted to be a part of
This scene is inspiring to me because it taught me that I should not worry about the times when something I wanted passed me by, it is just a part of life
Even though sometimes situations in life don’t turn out the way we want them to, it doesn’t mean they won’t turn out well, or that the order of the universe is not the order it should be
What I learned is that I can be successful with the strengths I have
I am the one who defines who I will become
My decisions will influence my destiny, but my ultimate destiny is a surprise yet to be unfolded, and I have learned that seizing opportunities to learn more about myself takes me one step closer to knowing just what my destiny may be
My Independent Kazakhstan - this is my home, my native land and my destiny!
